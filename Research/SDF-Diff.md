## Primary Contriubtions
- Differentially Renderer based on SDFs that supports ML.
- Mulit-view reconstruction using shape optimization. Involves use of Multi-resolution with gradient descent optimiation.
- Single-vew 3d reconstruction without 3d supervision.

## Other Literature
- [[DeepSDF]] paper talks about implicit representation.
- [[Deep Level Sets]] is an end-to-end model predicting implicit surfaces.
